# Slack to RSS
Create an RSS feed from links in your Slack channels

### Keeping up with links in Slack is hard

By day, I run SupportKit [the easiest way to chat with your web and mobile users](https://supportkit.io/?utm_source=slack2rss)

We've got a fairly sizeable team on it now and I find it difficult to keep up with all the articles and links that are shared across our channels on any given day

### Enter Slack to RSS

That's why I decided to build this handy little web app that generates an RSS feed of the links shared in any of your team's public Slack channels. You can add these feeds to any RSS reader, like Feedly or Flipboard, and then keep up with them on the go, in an interface made for reading.

### Get started in seconds

To get started, simply grab your API token for your Slack team. You can generate it [here](https://api.slack.com/web).

Next simply clicking this button to Deploy to Heroku and you'll be up and running: <a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/gozman/slack-rss/tree/master"><img src="https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png" alt="Deploy"></a>

### Want to build on this? Find a bug? Need help?

Feel free to fork the code and mess with it however you wish. It's licensed under the MIT license. If you find a bug, just create a PR. I don't code very much these days and most of this implementation may be a little hackish, so I'd appreciate improvements if you have any.

I'm not always able to answer quickly but I do try to help everyone out. Best way is to hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/gozmike).
